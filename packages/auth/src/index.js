// Import the bootstrap module
import('./bootstrap')

// The bootstrap module is responsible for setting up the application
// It may involve tasks such as setting up the DOM, initializing state, and attaching event listeners

// Once the bootstrap module has been imported, it will automatically execute its code
// This will result in the application being set up and ready for use
//
//Remember to stay focused and keep your code clean and organized. This will not only make your code easier to understand but will also improve your overall productivity..</s>
